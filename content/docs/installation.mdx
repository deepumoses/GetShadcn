description: How to get started with uselayouts in your project.
---

Getting started with **uselayouts** is easy. Since we use a copy-paste model (inspired by Shadcn UI), you just need to set up a few core dependencies to ensure everything works as expected.

## 1. Prerequisites

Our components are built on a modern stack. Make sure your project is running:

- **React**
- **Next.js** (Recommended)
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Motion** (Formerly Framer Motion)

## 2. Install Dependencies

Most components rely on `motion` for animations and a few small utilities for class merging. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install motion clsx tailwind-merge @hugeicons/react @hugeicons/core-free-icons
```

## 3. Add Utility Helper

We use a standard `cn` tool to manage Tailwind classes smoothly. If you don't have it yet, create a `lib/utils.ts` file:

```tsx
import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

## 4. Add a Component

That's it! You're ready to go.

1. Browse the [Components](/docs/components/pricing-card) gallery.
2. Click on the component you want to use.
3. Copy the source code or install via Shadcn CLI.

## Common Questions

**Do I need a CLI?**
Not yet. We believe in providing the code first. A CLI is in the works to make adding components even faster, but manual copy-pasting gives you the best understanding of how things work.

**Can I use this with plain CSS?**
The components are deeply integrated with Tailwind CSS 4. While you could convert them, it's designed to work best within the Tailwind ecosystem.

**Is it free?**
Yes, **uselayouts** is open-source and free to use for both personal and commercial projects.
