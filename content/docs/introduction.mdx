description: Elevating web layouts with premium motion and aesthetics.
---

**uselayouts** is a collection of premium, highly-polished layout components and micro-interactions designed to make your web apps feel alive.

Instead of fighting with boilerplate, you can copy and paste these components directly into your project. We've focused on the "hard parts"—the coordination of motion, responsive layouts, and the subtle details that make a UI feel premium.

## Why uselayouts?

The web has become a bit predictable. While standardization is great for accessibility, it sometimes leads to interfaces that feel... well, a bit repetitive.

**uselayouts** aims to inject some playfulness and "wow" factor back into the web. We re-create high-end patterns found on award-winning sites and package them into readable, copy-pasteable blocks that you can truly own.

- **Built for Speed**: Copy the code, paste it, and you're done. No heavy library wrappers.
- **Modern Stack**: Built with React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, and Motion.
- **Full Control**: Since the code lives in your project, you have total control over every animation and style.

## What's included?

We provide everything from complex hero sections and testimonial sliders to subtle micro-interactions like direction-aware tabs and magnetic buttons.
